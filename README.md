I am Zujun, currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science and working part-time as a backend developer. Before I continue my study in America, I work as a system administrator and site reliability engineer, creating automation tools for software developers, and providing monitoring, security and optimization solutions for applications.

I hope to get some modern theories about software architects, and the most up-to-date best practices. I have also been exposed to 'software architect' work before, not very in-depth, but I am very interested and hope to have the opportunity to engage in related work in the future.
